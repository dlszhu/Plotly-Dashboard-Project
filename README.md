# Plotly-Dashboard-Project
This is the final data visualization project for USC DSO545 using plotly dashboard. The Kaggle video game sales dataset was used and analyzed. https://www.kaggle.com/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset/code
The dashboard mainly shows the video game sales on the three major console platforms Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, in order to reflect the overall console game market trends. We define 3 different eras of console game: 1) 1999-2004 (the rise of major console platform) 2) 2005-2011 (golden age) and 3) 2012-2016 (shrinking market and competition of mobile as well as PC games). Specofically we looked at the "content strategy", with which the platform strategically releases or publishes certain genres or types of games to target different groups. We will evaluate their strategies by the critic scores, user scores, and the rise and fall of different game genres over the time. We also investigated the sales performance in different geographical location.
